        <h2>What does science say about race?</h2>
        <p>Many people will take biology to defend their racist ideologies, but what does biology truly say about this? According to biology there are no distinct genetic boundaries for the groups also known as races. Race could be considered a social construct. It was in fact firstly used by scientists. The reason to this being - those scientists wanted to separate subspecies from species, thus referring to the subspecies as <em>“races”</em>. However, they have discarded the term “race” as it was difficult to describe characteristics that made up those “races” and because geneticists have shown that there are more similarities between our species then there are genetic differences. As there are no distinct genetic boundaries, geneticists have discovered that for mammalian population – a species would have to have a score of 0.30 to be considered a true subspecies or race. <b>However humans only have a score of 0.156.</b> There are genetic variations between and within populations (even though it is quite small) – the most amount of genetic variation between our species isn’t found between people of African and European ancestry, but in fact between people of African ancestry. It is also known as <em>“the founder effect”</em> (the loss of genetic variation in a population founded by a small number of individuals). </p>
        <p>Racist ideologists will often defend their idea by the fact that our skin color, nose shape, eye shape etc. differs from others – however characteristics that are shown in races or our physical appearance is just a result of the climate and the environment surrounding us. It is well known that people who have darker skin tones adapted to sunny environments to prevent skin cancer. Those adaptations are called <b><em>“clines”</em> – clines are only genetic adaptations to a certain geographic environment</b>. Considering those facts we can come to the conclusion that - there are no races, only clines. The concept of human races was actually made famous during the Spanish Inquisition; however the concept of racism was only developed later, in colonial times. <strong>In conclusion – biology doesn’t support racist viewpoints.</strong></p>
        <h2>Why are people racist?</h2>
        <p>Even after knowledge of such matters, it raises the question - “Why are people racist if “race” is not a real concept in biology?” We can consider race as a social construct as it is a product of society. However another question rises <em><b>“Is racism a consequence of human nature or just learned behavior?”</b></em>. Even though our primal instincts are to be wary of unknown things, racism should be considered a cultural adaptation instead of a genetic adaptation. Suspicion of others and racist attitudes towards people with different ancestry are only learned behavior and it depends on our socialization and education. Making incorrect judgments against people of different origins can only lead to unnecessary hate and have deeper psychological impact on the person being discriminated. Genetic diversity is actually considered as positive as it leads to robust and brings healthy offspring’s. While low genetic diversity (which was actually Nazi’s ideal society – they strived towards “racial purity”) can lead to inbreeding.</p>
