        <h3>Who was Martin Luther King Jr.?</h3>

        <p>Martin Luther King Jr. is a well know figure in black history, he was an inspirational minister, powerful visionary and leader of the Civil Rights Movement. Although his family was deeply involved in the church and worship, King questioned religion in general and felt uncomfortable with overly emotional displays of religious worship. This discomfort continued through much of his adolescence, initially leading him to decide against entering the ministry, much to his father's dismay. But in his junior year, King took a Bible class, renewed his faith and began to envision a career in the ministry.</p>
        <p>King's skillful rhetoric put new energy into the civil rights struggle in Alabama. During The Montgomery Bus Boycott both his and Nixon’s homes were attacked. In January 1957, King and 60 ministers and civil rights activists founded the <em>Southern Christian Leadership Conference</em> to harness the moral authority and organizing power of Black churches. They would help conduct non-violent protests to promote civil rights reform. These non-violent protests were heavily inspired by Mahatma Gandhi’s non-violent activism (King even visited Gandhi’s birthplace in India). </p>
        <p><em>The Greensboro sit-in movement</em> – in February 1960, a group of African American students in North Carolina refused to sit in the “colored section” of racially segregated lunch counters in the city's stores. The students remained seated and were therefore subjected to verbal and sometimes physical violence. King encouraged the students to continue with their non-violent protest. There was even an incident on October 19, 1960, when King and 75 students entered a local department store and requested lunch-counter service but were denied. When they refused to leave the counter area, King and 36 others were arrested.</p>
        <p>In the spring of 1963, King organized a demonstration in downtown Birmingham, Alabama. Unfortunately, city police turned dogs and fire hoses on demonstrators. King was jailed along with large numbers of his supporters, but the event drew nationwide attention. This has caused King to write his famous <em>Letter from Birmingham jail</em> (in it he explains the importance of non-violent protests). </p>
        <p>On August 28, 1963, <strong>the March on Washington</strong> drew more than 200,000 people in the shadow of the Lincoln Memorial. It was here that King made his famous <em><strong>"I Have a Dream"</strong></em> speech – <em>“I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character”.</em> </p>
        <p>His speech had a strong effect on the public. More and more white people began to question the morality of Jim Crow laws and the position that black people were subjected to.</p>
        <p>Finally, this resulted in the passage of <em>the Civil Rights Act of 1964</em>, which outlawed any sort of discrimination and attempt of segregation in publicly owned facilities. King also received the Nobel Peace Prize the same year. </p>
        <p>Martin Luther King was assassinated by a shooter named James Earl Ray. Before this event he had given his final speech <em><strong>“I’ve Been to the Mountaintop”</strong></em>, somewhat predicting his own death - <em>"I've seen the promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight that we, as a people, will get to the Promised Land".</em></p>
