        <h1>INTRODUCTION TO RACISM</h1>
    </header>
        <p>Unfortunately, one of the most ongoing topics; in the past and in the present is racism. Racism is a problem that modern-day public should not take lightly in any sort of way, as it has an impact on every layer of society. Racism has already had an enormous influence on our everyday lives. I believe it is a problem that we need more education on, we should educate our youth about history behind the notion of racism (having proper etiquette when talking to a person of color should be included since most of children in Serbia or some smaller countries aren’t closely related to (or have seen) any children or people of different races). Racism by itself is a term that applies to all races and all races can fall victim to it, however it mostly alludes to black people as mentions of what they have gone through and are still going through are noteworthy. </p>

        <p>Personally, I have chosen this topic mostly because I consider that it is of utmost importance that every individual has awareness of such topics and as such I would like to research them as thoroughly as possible. Working on this topic I have gained knowledge that I deem necessary in everyday life. Even if it is not considered “our history”, we have to learn from its wrong doings and acts of righteousness. The knowledge of history itself is important for us not to make the same mistakes. Although it is not visible to the naked eye, our country has its own shares of racism towards other minor communities (especially towards the Romani people). I would like for all of us to be as accepting as possible towards members of other ethnicities and overall their culture. A person should not be defined by their outer appearance but by their actions. Let’s not forget the fact that people’s surroundings usually give them certain opinions on the world around them. Of course, people can go out of their way and defy the racist attitudes that they have been thought all along. Racism makes people feel sorry for being born a certain way, of having a particular skin color. Racism has no scientific explanation, and the racist people are entirely ignorant about the feelings of other human beings. </p>

        <p>The sole idea that people’s race gives them superiority to others created abusive behavior towards members of other races. We must not blame anyone else but ourselves for these inexcusable actions – it may be the type of behavior that we are thought but it does not stop us from acting against everyone’s beliefs. It is possible to eradicate racism in our society if we are more open about such sensitive topics and give simple matters like this a thought. Most of us are way too self-centered to think about such obstacles. It is so commonplace a behavior that we forget its adverse effects. We need to let go of narrow-minded beliefs. Only then can we advance as a society.</p>
